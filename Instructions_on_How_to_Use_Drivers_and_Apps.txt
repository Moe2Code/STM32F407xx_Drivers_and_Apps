INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE STM32F407XX DRIVERS AND APPS

Hardware Used:

1- STM32F407G DISCOVERY board, Qty 1
2- A000066 Arduino Uno, Qty 1
3- 3-01-0015 HiLetgo USB Logic Analyzer, Qty 1
4- Jumper wires (Male to Male (Qty 10), Female to Female (Qty 10), Male to Female (Qty 10))

Software Used:

1- Eclipse based System WorkBench IDE (SW4STM32), Version 1.8 or later
2- ST-LINK/V2 Device Driver (Onboard Programmer and Debugger for Discovery board)
3- Saleae Logic, Version 1.2.18 (Software to analyze protocol signals)

Wiring:

- Each application may require different wiring on Discovery board, or both, Discovery and Arduino Uno boards
- The wiring will be detailed in Discovery's src files (within folder "src") and Arduino's sketches (within the folder "sketches")

How to run each application:

- Load Discovery's drivers and applications on the IDE. Build the application of interest and flash on Discovery board
- Load the Arduino Uno sketch needed to work with Discovery's application
- Follow the instructions for the application. This is detailed within source file for Discovery and the sketch for Arduino Uno
